## 💪 Interview Talking Points Prep

### ✅ Architecture Decision Rationale
- [ ] **"Why Debezium over custom CDC?"** - Proven, maintainable, Apple values stability
- [ ] **"Why Circuit Breakers?"** - At Apple scale, cascading failures are catastrophic  
- [ ] **"Why Avro + Schema Registry?"** - Schema evolution is Apple's biggest operational pain
- [ ] **"Why Event Filtering?"** - Not all changes matter, intelligent filtering saves resources

### ✅ Scale Discussion Preparation
- [ ] **Current Performance**: "Handles 100K events/sec on laptop"
- [ ] **Apple Scale Strategy**: "10M events/sec needs horizontal sharding by user_id hash"
- [ ] **Linear Scaling**: "Backpressure and batching patterns scale with partition count"
- [ ] **Zero Downtime**: "Schema evolution prevents deployment freezes"

### ✅ Production Readiness Answers
- [ ] **"What's missing for production?"** - Multi-region replication, topic compaction
- [ ] **"How would you monitor this?"** - ML anomaly detection, data quality monitoring
- [ ] **"Disaster recovery strategy?"** - Cross-region backup, automated failover
- [ ] **"Security considerations?"** - Data anonymization, access controls, audit trails
